# Weather Py

I have created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distances from the equator. To accomplish this, I have used a Python library and an OpenWeatherMap API. 

#### This Challenge will include scatter plots of:

- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Next, I have run a linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

- Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
